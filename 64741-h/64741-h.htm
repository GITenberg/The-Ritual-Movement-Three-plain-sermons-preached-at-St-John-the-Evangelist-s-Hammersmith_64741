<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>SERMON
I.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1 <span
class="smcap">Corinthians</span> xiv. 40.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Let all things be done
decently and in order.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> words are a general precept
about Church order following up a particular remonstrance.&nbsp;
The Corinthian Christians, divinely distinguished by the number
and excellence of the spiritual gifts and privileges bestowed on
them, had, alas! distinguished themselves by anarchy,
lawlessness, pride, self-will, self-sufficiency,
uncharitableness, ecclesiastical and moral laxity of various
forms and kinds.&nbsp; The Apostle deals with all these offences
severally and particularly, and then he gives a general
rule&mdash;a rule which was to cover and guide all their
practice, and the practice of every other church: &ldquo;Let all
things be done decently (decorously) and in order&rdquo;
(according to system and appointment).</p>
<p>Without further preface, I would, in all solemnity, read this
precept as addressed to us, brethren, to the clergy and laity of
the Anglican Church of this present day, and as one which for the
glory of God, and the edifying of ourselves, it is most needful
to fix in our remembrance and to observe with all
strictness.&nbsp; And did I design my teaching to be merely
general, <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>I
know no more useful theme to which to address myself; for as like
the Corinthians we Anglicans have been distinguished by God, in
that He has poured out upon us conspicuous and super-excellent
gifts and privileges, so like them are we constantly
distinguishing ourselves by strifes, irregularities, and
miserable assertions of self&rsquo;s importance and self&rsquo;s
wilfulness unparalleled, I believe, by Romans, Greeks, or
dissenters.</p>
<p>But I have a special purpose, as you have probably
anticipated, in selecting the subject for consideration at this
time.</p>
<p>There is just now a great agitation throughout the land about
what is called &ldquo;The Ritual Movement.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
many years of sluggish indifference to the Apostle&rsquo;s
precept&mdash;it would hardly exceed the truth to say of perverse
opposition to it, in doing all things indecently and against
order&mdash;men on all sides are waking up to a sense of their
neglect, and to a desire to repair it; and, by consequence, those
who have not gone with the movement have found themselves
surrounded by what wears the appearance of strange and even
dangerous innovation, and those who have gone with it&mdash;both
teachers and disciples&mdash;have in some cases been hurried
along without due care to consider, perhaps without time to
consider, whither they were tending.</p>
<p>To both these parties&mdash;the standers still and the
hurriers along&mdash;how wisely speaks the precept, &ldquo;Let
all things be done decently and in order&rdquo;!</p>
<p>And first to the first&mdash;the standers still&mdash;the
&ldquo;old-fashioned,&rdquo; the contented with things as they
were.&nbsp; Consider, my brethren, what mean ye by the service of
God in the sanctuary, the assembling of yourselves in Church from
time to time.&nbsp; Why do you come?&nbsp; Who bade you come?
what to do?&nbsp; You come to worship God in a building set apart
for His worship; a place in which He may meet you by
appointment.&nbsp; And who is God?&nbsp; The great and glorious
Jehovah, in Whose sight the very Heavens are not clean; Who asks,
asserting His dignity, &ldquo;What place will ye build Me&rdquo;
(that is worthy of Me)?&nbsp; My brethren, <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>if you duly
regarded His Majesty, if you, in any adequate degree, appreciated
His amazing condescension, would you consider any edifice too
grand for His localised presence, any expenditure on its
furniture and ornament too lavish, any care for its arrangement
and for the reverent honour of its All Holy Tenant too elaborate,
too scrupulously particular?&nbsp; You know what provision you
would make, what anxious care would possess you to fit your
house, to array and order your household, for the due
entertaining of an expected guest <i>only just a little</i> above
yourselves in dignity and in claim to be respected.&nbsp; You can
hardly imagine <i>what</i> you would do if your Queen
condescended to be for a while your guest; but you know that at
least you would not err on the side of niggardliness,
slovenliness, and indifference; that your provision would be as
magnificent as possible, your service particular and constant,
your reverence profound.&nbsp; This being the case&mdash;and you
know it is the case&mdash;a lively belief that God does
wondrously vouchsafe to dwell with you, that the Church is indeed
His local habitation, that when you enter within its walls, you
are in His available, His very tangible presence; that what you
do or neglect there, is done or neglected to Him, would
spontaneously beget in you the desire, and quicken the effort, to
make the edifice worthy of Him, according to your natural notions
of worthiness, to provide due accessories of worship, to order
yourselves as real and most reverential worshippers.</p>
<p>But you are not left to spontaneity.&nbsp; When God chose for
Himself a people to honour and serve Him, to be witnesses for His
honour, to bring in due time all nations to serve and worship
Him, He taught that people what kind of House they should build
Him, and with what kind of ritual they should serve Him; treating
the matter of such importance as actually to inspire the
architects, to prescribe each article of furniture and every
detail of ornament, to appoint precisely the ceremonies and
observances.&nbsp; And what did He require?&nbsp; That <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the material of
house and ornament should be of the best and costliest and most
splendid; that every act, every feeling of worship should have
its corresponding sign in some ritualistic observance; that among
the accessories of worship should be attractions for means of
enlisting men&rsquo;s various senses; colour, and pattern and
ornament for the eye, music for the ear, fragrant perfume for the
scent.</p>
<p>This is God&rsquo;s pattern of what is decorous: His
prescription of order.</p>
<p>But you object: &ldquo;No, this <i>was</i> God&rsquo;s pattern
and order: but it was all appointed under a different
dispensation from Christianity, for a rude and childish people,
as pictures and types and carnal ordinances, to be exchanged when
men were fit, when the Messiah should come, for inward and
invisible realities, for purely spiritual things, which heart and
mind alone could apprehend, which outward sense would rather
obscure than discover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, of course, Judaism was in some respects a different
dispensation from Christianity, and some even of its divinely
appointed observances were merely temporary, and had a
significance and use for Jews which they would not have for
us.&nbsp; But it is quite an error to suppose that these Jews
were a rude and childish people; they were rather the civilised
and cultivated and most spiritual of the earth.&nbsp; Albeit, if
we might dare to say so, for them more than for us, or for any
other people whom God has since drawn near to Himself, an
elaborate outward and sensuous worship (if it were not the right,
the necessary, the permanent accompaniment of inward realities)
was unsuitable and fraught with danger.&nbsp; They had just come
out from the home of idolatry; they were going to dwell among the
observers of carnal and idolatrous rites; they were themselves
hankering after visible objects of worship; they would again and
again make stumbling blocks for themselves out of the very things
which God appointed for their edification in His worship.&nbsp;
Now ascribing to God, as we must always do, perfect wisdom and <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>clearest
foresight, is it presumptuous to say that He would have kept
these snares from the Jews, that he would have drawn off their
minds from the external and the naturally magnificent, and rather
would have <i>forbidden</i> than <i>enforced</i> minute ritual
and much worship of the body, as things through which they were
sure to err, unless there were in the things themselves intrinsic
good, unless, in fact, they were not merely useful accessories of
worship, but a very integral and essential part of the worship
itself?</p>
<p>And then, again, my brethren, where are we told that
Christianity is a <i>purely spiritual religion</i>; that its
functions are all such as can be performed by mind and heart,
without body; that, in fact, the body has no real part in
them?&nbsp; The worship of the body is indeed no worship by
itself, for: &ldquo;God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him
must worship Him in spirit and in truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; But is it
not Christianity that has redeemed and consecrated the
body?&nbsp; Has not the second Adam taken away from it all but
its <i>form</i> of mortality?&nbsp; Has not the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> purchased it for Himself, imposing upon
it much work in His service; commanding by His inspired Apostle
that it should glorify Him; promising it great excellencies and
rewards in its future state; appointing for it a glorious worship
in heaven?&nbsp; Assuredly, my brethren, as man is three-fold and
has been redeemed in his three-fold nature, mind, heart, and
body, so has each part of him its appointed, its bounden part, to
take <i>on its own account</i> in the positive worship of
God.&nbsp; And were it not so, were the body merely the case of
the soul&mdash;its link with the material; its tabernacle in the
temporal; its agent among the natural and outward&mdash;still, is
it not in these respects part of its office to exhibit what is in
the soul?&nbsp; Does not the soul naturally move it when it is
moved itself?&nbsp; Is not the body, as it were spontaneously,
affected by all that passes within, and, unless unnaturally
restrained or physically disabled, does it not always betray and
manifest the inward affection?</p>
<p>The soul may worship God sufficiently (for the whole being) <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>when the body
is taking no part by reason of paralysis or prostration, or
because the man, deeming it inexpedient at that time that sound
or sign should escape him, is curbing and binding it down; but in
health and left unrestrained, the body is such a spontaneous
sympathizer and persistent co-operator with all within, that we
are justified in saying of him who does not speak to God with his
lips, and bow his head before Him, and clasp his hands, and kneel
upon his knees, that he does not worship God in spirit and in
truth!</p>
<p>We have reached thus far, brethren&mdash;if you have gone with
me&mdash;that God has prescribed much ritual, and that man from
his very nature must use much ritual in divine worship.</p>
<p>Of course God&rsquo;s prescription is liable to much
modification when it comes to be applied, not to one people, but
to all the nations of the earth; not to a tabernacle in the
wilderness or a temple at Jerusalem, but to every place in which
men ask him to record His name and come unto them and bless them;
not to dim and imperfect types, but to the glorious and perfect
anti-types; not to Judaism, which was local and temporary, but to
Christianity, which is universal and eternal.&nbsp; Of course,
too, the <i>details</i> of men&rsquo;s spontaneous worship will,
necessarily, be different according to the truth which they have
to express by outward signs, according to their natural
characteristics in a warm or cold climate, according even to
individual temperament.</p>
<p>But this principle assuredly holds good for all time and for
all men: that God having once pronounced Himself in favour of a
certain kind of ritual, and His Church having consented to
express its doctrines and its feelings by certain outward signs
and rites of its own, the general rule and form of decent and
orderly worship has been set and established, which should only
be departed from by Divine sanction and appointment, unless,
indeed, the doctrines and feelings which we have to express are
so diverse from those of the elder Church that they cannot find
an intelligent and real expression in the same ritual.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>You will
hardly need, brethren, that I should prove to you that our
religion is substantially that which God gave to the Jews; that
under the old dispensation as under the new, salvation is offered
to mankind only through Jesus Christ, and that the general ways
of seeking and keeping hold of that salvation&mdash;humbling
ourselves before God, initiation into His covenant, constant
prayer, supplication and praise, constant pleadings of His
sacrifice, constant feeding on His grace, are the same for us as
for them, unless God Himself has changed them.&nbsp; Now this we
know that He has done in some respects, taking away circumcision,
the daily sacrifice of animals, and the Passover, and various
rites and ceremonies which, from the nature of the case, could be
only temporary; or, at least, had real use and significance only
for the nation of the Jews, or for an <i>expectant</i>
Church.&nbsp; But then He has given us other ordinances <i>in the
place of those withdrawn</i>, and these we <i>naturally</i>
observe in the same spirit, and, as far as suits them, with the
same form as He appointed for the older ordinances.&nbsp; God is
still the same: man is still the same.&nbsp; The expression of
worship which He once required, is that which He must surely
still require in all its essentials, all its characteristics.</p>
<p>That the Christian Church accepted at once this rule of
worship is evident from the fact, that the apostles and first
disciples continued to take part in the temple and synagogue
services as long as the Jews would let them; yea, and that they
even still observed those ordinances which, in their necessary
observance, God had abrogated; instead of which He had appointed
other things.&nbsp; This, my brethren, is most worthy of note,
because it shows that these men, full of the Spirit, discerned
that they had still the same God to worship, and that, as far as
circumstances would let them, the natural way&mdash;the right
way&mdash;of worshipping was that which their fathers had
followed; so much so that they might even still retain&mdash;as
long as it could be done without injury, with
edification&mdash;those very ordinances <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>which, in
their binding, their sacramental character, by God&rsquo;s
declaration, belonged not to Christianity!</p>
<p>But God left it not to this pious, conservative feeling to
maintain the dignity and splendour of His worship.&nbsp; As in
the Mount He had given Moses a pattern and a law of all things
that men should make and do for His worship in the Church on
earth; so in Patmos to the beloved disciple, to him who had drunk
in most deeply the spirit of Christ, to him who was to teach men
more than any other prophet of the real, the abiding, the
spiritual, the heavenly&mdash;to him, I say, God opened a door in
heaven, and showed the things that must be hereafter, the worship
that is to be celebrated and perpetuated in His fullest Presence;
and lo! it was full of visible glories and ceremonial
observances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; men say: &ldquo;but surely that must be
allowed to be figurative&mdash;to be a mere pictorial way of
describing inward and invisible truths and feelings.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We are not so sure of that, brethren.&nbsp; Heaven must be a
substantial and tangible place; because those who are to inhabit
it will have bodies to rest in it, and eyes, and ears and other
senses to find gratification in it.&nbsp; And if it is such a
place, and is full of objects which affect the body, and which
the body may employ, then I see not why much of what the Apostle
saw in vision may not be a literal representation of what shall
actually be.&nbsp; But concede that it is only an image, a
pictorial representation, nevertheless it is God who has chosen
these things to symbolize His perpetual worship; and are we best
preparing ourselves for that worship&mdash;best rehearsing it,
best professing it, best honouring Him, doing all things decently
and in order, if we set aside in His worship all that He once
enjoined in letter upon His early Church, all that He has
used&mdash;figuratively, if you will&mdash;as fittest to
represent to us His perfect worship in the Church triumphant,
and, I suppose, to enlist our present interest, and to kindle a
hearty intelligent desire for a full share in it hereafter?</p>
<p>But here, again, men object.&nbsp; They will concede that,
perhaps, <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>there may be <i>something</i> literal in this
prophetical description; at any rate that it symbolizes
faithfully and precisely the spiritual homage, the joy and
adoration of souls which shall be in heaven.&nbsp; But they
assert that it does not symbolize&mdash;that, in fact, it is in
very contrast with all the state and feeling which belong to us
poor wandering and afflicted pilgrims and prodigals on earth.</p>
<p>My brethren, if there were no other argument in favour of
maintaining or of restoring where it has fallen into decay such a
ritual as I am advocating, this one objection would furnish a
most cogent reason for it,&mdash;a very necessity; for what does
it show but that men have lost the truth which this ritual
embodies and expresses&mdash;namely, that while indeed <i>in the
world</i> they are still pilgrims, still prodigals distant from
home, though sighing for and seeking that home, beholders of
promises <i>afar off</i>, yet in the <i>Church</i> they are <i>at
home</i>, having <i>obtained</i> the promises.&nbsp; The Church
is the ark of salvation, which God has provided to keep us safe
in the drowning of the world.&nbsp; It is the kingdom of heaven,
whose King is now in the midst of it.&nbsp; It is the bosom of
the Father whereon each penitent prodigal now rests accepted, the
Everlasting arms whose felt embrace assures of present peace and
joy.&nbsp; It is the wedding feast whereat all the friends of the
King&rsquo;s son are decked with glories and feasted with good
things; nay, it is the Bride herself, adorned for the Bridegroom,
the King&rsquo;s daughter, all glorious and full of joy!</p>
<p>What present comfort in the troubles of this lower life, what
cheering in despondency, what stimulus in toilsome effort do we
not miss, my brethren, by not realizing that in the Church we are
come unto Mount Zion, unto the heavenly Jerusalem&mdash;unto the
very throne, into the very presence, within the enfolding arms of
the God who has saved us, Who loves to fill us full of peace, and
joy, and benediction <i>now</i>.</p>
<p>And, alas! what do we not in our blindness or misconception
withhold from God&mdash;of that most reasonable, that greatly
due, <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>that
loudly-demanded service&mdash;the perpetual sacrifice of praise
and thanksgiving for the past mercies of our redemption, for our
continual sustentation through the intercession of our Great High
Priest, by the grace which He continually gives us; for the
coming glory which, being promised, is sure on His part, and most
certainly needs to be acknowledged with grateful, hearty, and
adoring lives!</p>
<p>If, my brethren, it is the aim of &ldquo;the ritual
movement&rdquo; to express all this grand truth, and to help men
to live by it, then surely they are doing a great work who have
originated and are carrying on the movement; and we are
inconsiderately depriving ourselves of much that is helpful and
edifying&mdash;that, I say, not withholding from God due and most
acceptable worship&mdash;if we allow our prejudices to oppose the
movement, so far as it is lawful, and either insist upon
prescribing for ourselves a ritual, or labour to uphold and
stereotype one that has no likeness in the Old and New Testament,
in the Church of any age, in our own Book of Common Prayer.</p>
<p>Some of you may think, my brethren, that I have not chosen the
fittest theme for Lent sermons.&nbsp; But recollect that this
season is specially appointed for the self-discipline and growth
in grace and in all godliness of those who are already in some
sense religious; and then put it to yourselves whether the
rooting out of you of stubborn prejudices, uncharitable and
unworthy suspicions (with the many bitter, unchristian fruits
that follow them), and that miserable spirit of formalism which
delights in finding objections to a form and in refusing
conformity, would not greatly help you to worship God in spirit
and in truth.</p>
<p>There are dangers inherent in high ritual, it is being greatly
abused, and of those who desire it many are wholly misconceiving
its spirit and its use.&nbsp; To these I shall speak in turn, if
God will, with the same affectionate boldness and desire to be
faithful, which have influenced me in all that I have now
said.</p>
<p>Meantime, beloved, remember that we are all brethren, saved <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>from the same
destruction, redeemed with the same precious blood, sanctified by
the same spirit, called with the same calling, and to the same
service, inheritors of the same heaven, worshippers of the same
God.&nbsp; Strive not, then, with one another.&nbsp; Judge not,
that ye be not judged.&nbsp; Do not exaggerate differences; try
rather to lay aside differences.&nbsp; Seek each one what may
edify others, and all what may honour God.&nbsp; Endeavour to
take, each and all of you, your due part in <i>common</i>
worship.&nbsp; Ask God&rsquo;s Spirit to show you out of His own
Word, illustrated by the testimony of His Church, what <i>is</i>
common worship; and soon, if you do so, you will come to agree
with and to join fervently and profitably in all that is really
essential to the right adoration of our ever and all-glorious
God.</p>

That an unmajestic worship<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth Thy Majesty beseem;<br />
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Show them
more of Thy dear Presence,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let them, let them come to know,<br />
That our King is throned among us,<br />

<p>Then shall faith read off the meaning<br />

Men shall learn how sacred splendour<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; With the colours and the gold;<br />
Thine the floral glow and fragrance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine the vestures&rsquo; fair array,<br />
Thine the starry lights that glitter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Thou dost Thy light display.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis to Thee the chant is lifted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis to Thee the heads are bowed;<br />
Far less deep was Israel&rsquo;s rapture<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the glory filled the cloud.<br />
O our own true God incarnate,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Of their pride and joy in Thee.</p>
<p>What but this? yet since corruption<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Finds with Thee a perfect home.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">I <span
class="smcap">Corinthians</span> xiv. 40.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Let all things be done
decently and in order.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <span class="smcap">endeavoured</span> last Sunday to
exhibit the principle and rationale of Christian ritualistic
service.&nbsp; I reminded you that God had Himself prescribed for
Israel an elaborate and splendid ritual, and that, moreover, He
had shown in vision to the eagle-eyed Apostle, either what should
actually be His worship in heaven, or what would, in figure, most
fitly represent it to us, and stimulate us to an interest in it,
and a desire and aim to prepare ourselves for a share in
it.&nbsp; I further urged, that man&rsquo;s natural feeling,
rightly enlightened as to its relationship with God, would
spontaneously have prompted him&mdash;has, in fact, prompted
him&mdash;to make such a manifestation of inward devotion, such
an external homage and worship, such an use in God&rsquo;s honour
of the things which the senses approve as costly, excellent,
beautiful, edifying, joy-inspiring, joy-proclaiming,
glorifying.&nbsp; Hence I deduced the rule, that&mdash;God being
always quite the same, and man being always much the
same&mdash;in the absence of any Divine reversal or modification;
or, on man&rsquo;s part, of any realised unsuitableness to
altered times and circumstances; the same kind of ritual and
service of body and offering of substance, must, to speak
generally, be upheld and used by us as was actually imposed upon
the Jews by God or by themselves, <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>and has been foreshadowed, whether in
figure or letter, of the Church triumphant in heaven.&nbsp; It
had to be conceded that God has made a charge in the details by
the absolute repeal of some service, and by modifications and
substitutions affecting Christians generally; and, moreover, that
the service of different nations by reason of their various
temperaments, and their peculiar ways of estimating and using
some of the things of which sense takes cognizance, <i>must</i>,
to be natural, differ in particulars from somewhat of that which
Eastern people actually did and offered.&nbsp; Making these
concessions, I endeavoured to maintain that such ritual as is
prescribed in the Jewish law and pictured in the Apocalypse is to
be regarded as appointed or approved by God for Christians; that
its observance is necessary to the due expression and offering of
intelligent hearty and acceptable common worship, and that it is
very serviceable to the worshippers in kindling, guiding and
sustaining the spirit of true devotion.</p>
<p>Christendom at large has so judged, and has acted upon the
judgment from the very first Whit-Sunday; using these things with
the Jews as long as it was allowed to do so, and providing them
for itself as soon as it had liberty and means of providing
them.&nbsp; I need not occupy your time in proving this
statement.&nbsp; All of you probably are aware that at least as
soon as the Roman Emperors gave their protection and
encouragement to the Christian Church, and ever since then, in
east or west, in north or south (till some 300 years ago, when
the rule began to be departed from <i>in practice</i> by the
Anglican branch), the Scriptural rule and pattern have been
followed.&nbsp; Everywhere, when possible, men have erected
stately and costly Houses of Prayer; they have adorned them with
all the skill which art could exercise; they have furnished them
with all the magnificence that the worshippers could afford; they
have observed in them a grand and elaborate ritual, whose
outline, whose main features are to be found in the Pentateuch
and the Apocalypse.&nbsp; They have employed the same symbols and
furniture; the lamps <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>or lights representing the Divine
presence; the altar of memorial sacrifice; the holy incense,
originally compounded after God&rsquo;s own proscription and
significant of that meritorious intercession of our Great High
Priest which alone makes acceptable and carries up into heaven
our poor and unworthy service on earth; the white albs or
surplices of the officiating ministers&mdash;the outward sign of
the purity and righteousness which the worshippers, whose leaders
these ministers are, should possess; the splendid robe of the
Celebrant, who is the representative, in all his acts of
intercession, absolution, consecration, oblation, benediction, of
our great and glorified High Priest.&nbsp; Read Church history
from the beginning, and where do you find (save among
insignificant sects) anything different from this?&nbsp; Go into
any place of worship (out of England) belonging to the body
Catholic, whether of the east or west, and though it will
possibly be among many additions, many perversions from their
original purpose, many corruptions, and, alas! that it must be
owned, often among many abominations, you will still be able to
discern all the leading features of the same <i>one</i> rule and
pattern of Divine worship.</p>
<p>I have said &ldquo;out of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; You know that
this would not be the case in England or in English
dependencies.&nbsp; Many of you rejoice in the difference; you
think you can give a good account of it; you are able to justify
its origin; you are disposed to maintain, if you can, its
continuance.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Reformation did away with all
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Reformation did away with all that</i>!&nbsp; Is it
possible that worshippers of Jehovah, men who owe all their
peace, their privileges and blessings to their membership of
Christ&rsquo;s Church, can for a moment allow and do not rather
with horror shout down the fearful assertion, that their
community has abolished for itself the ritual of Scripture, and
has cut itself off from all the Church that went before it, and
all that lies around it?&nbsp; That is what the statement
&ldquo;The Reformation has changed all this,&rdquo; <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>implies!&nbsp; Which of you my brethren would not
repudiate and thrust it away thus nakedly exhibited?&nbsp; Which
of you would not feel that if it were true the Reformation was a
curse, and not a blessing, and that no effort must be spared to
undo it?&nbsp; Which of you would not sink to the earth beneath
what would then be the righteous taunt of the
Romanist:&mdash;that we have no covenanted part or lot with
Christ&rsquo;s Church?</p>
<p>Do not start away from such a statement of the case.&nbsp; I
am not misrepresenting the argument.&nbsp; I am not exaggerating
minor matters.&nbsp; I am not denying, I freely own and stoutly
maintain, that each branch of the Church has authority and power
to change and change again and again many of her rites and
ceremonies&mdash;the details, perhaps, of every one of
them&mdash;so long as all be done in accordance with God&rsquo;s
word: above all I am not foolishly alleging that altar lights, or
incense, or chasuble, or any such thing is of such importance as
to make or unmake a Church, or is really necessary in the
Christian Church at all.&nbsp; I have mentioned these things only
as particular illustrations of a system of Ritualistic Service,
much of which was taught us by God, and which has been adopted by
the universal Church and used everywhere and in all ages.&nbsp;
And I say that if the Reformers had deliberately rejected all
God&rsquo;s pattern and all Christendom&rsquo;s use, and had
prescribed for themselves and for us things altogether not only
different but <i>opposite</i>, then they would have inflicted a
curse upon us, and it would be our bounden duty to repudiate them
and to undo their work.</p>
<p>I have spoken thus plainly and openly in the earnest desire to
awaken, to a sense of what they are countenancing, those who
carelessly, or it may be deliberately, out of honest and zealous
prejudice, represent the Reformation as having made all things
new.&nbsp; If once men can be brought to feel that it would have
been wrong to make all things new, they will be at pains to
inquire with all anxiety whether they have not misconceived the
Reformation, and so inquiring, they will come to see what it
really <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>did
or aimed at, and hence to believe that the Ritual movement of the
present day&mdash;I am not, of course, speaking of the
extravagancies and eccentricities of individuals&mdash;so far
from ignoring, contravening, and overturning the principles of
the Reformation, is the very carrying of them out.</p>
<p>Were I not convinced that it is so, God forbid that I should
stand here as a vindicator of the movement.&nbsp; For I am
persuaded that the Reformation was most righteous and necessary,
and that God Himself specially wrought it for us.&nbsp; However
gently we should always speak in controversy, however charitably
we should think of and construe the acts and motives of others,
we must not hide from ourselves that the unreformed Church of
this country, in the sixteenth century, was in a very corrupt and
ungodly state.&nbsp; The <i>form</i>, indeed, of all the
essentials of Christianity was maintained, but it was overlaid by
man&rsquo;s idle, or even false traditions and man&rsquo;s
corrupt practices.&nbsp; The power of the priesthood was abused;
the word of God was withheld from the people; the Holy Eucharist
was mutilated and perverted from the purposes of its institution;
in worship, the creature was set side by side with the Creator,
if not exalted above Him; the substitution of <i>form</i> for
spirit and substance, and in many cases of a wrong form, too, was
generally sanctioned and encouraged.&nbsp; From all this the
Reformers were stirred to rescue us, and by the grace of God they
did it.&nbsp; But theirs was no hot-headed indiscriminate
work.&nbsp; They laboured, with all the calmness that men in
their trying circumstances could command, to distinguish between
right and wrong.&nbsp; They wished to retain all that seemed
edifying, or even merely harmless, though it were of recent
growth.&nbsp; They sought to restore all things to the primitive
rule and pattern.&nbsp; They would have counted it sin to have
rejected anything that God had suggested to His Church or that
the Church in former ages had adopted.&nbsp; Let any one acquaint
himself with the doctrine, ritual, and practice of the unreformed
Church, and then compare with them the first Prayer Book <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>of Edward
VI., and he will find that there is no unnecessary deviation from
them; that there is a strict maintenance of everything that it
was possible to retain without fostering error or obstructing
Christian edification; that the Reformers even went beyond, and
revived and enforced what had been disused and forgotten&mdash;if
it had early sanction&mdash;leaving nothing unrestored that had
primitive authority, save only the godly discipline of Penance;
and how they thought of that, how they wished to restore it, how
they hoped that the time would come when it would be restored,
let the Commination Office testify!</p>
<p>This was the principle of the Reformation.&nbsp; And how was
it carried out in the matter of ritual?&nbsp; Why! everything
that was Scriptural or primitive, or, though recent, edifying,
was retained.&nbsp; There were the same Churches, the same
altars, the same symbols and furniture, the same vestments.&nbsp;
Even the same services and the same ways of offering them were
preserved; only they were cleansed from corruptions, divested of
things doubtful or unedifying, simplified by making prayers and
lections more continuous, and by discountenancing those
minuti&aelig; of bodily worship&mdash;numerous bowings,
genuflections, and the like&mdash;which, however natural they may
have been to the foreign Priests who had ministered at our
altars, however useful to the people when, by reason of all being
performed in an unknown and muttered tongue, much dumb show and
bell ringing were necessary, were distracting to true worship by
their multiplicity, and were unnecessary in an audible and
intelligible service.</p>
<p>I do not say that everything which this ritual movement seeks
to restore is distinctly by name approved and retained by our
Reformers; but in its general features, in almost all its items,
in the kind of worship and confession of faith at which it aims,
I am sure that it has their sanction and is the taking up of
their work.</p>
<p>How is it that this ritual has never been the generally used
ritual of the Reformed Church?&nbsp; Why should it now be
revived?&mdash;<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>these are questions which, if God will, I will answer in
detail in my next sermon.</p>
<p>Meantime, my brethren, strive to make profitable and personal
use of what has been said, by carefully informing yourselves as
to the real state of the case; by trying to root out of you
prejudices, and to keep yourselves from uncharitable suspicions
of ritualists and rash and profane speech about ritual; by
cultivating respect for the motives of those who, in their labour
to be loyal to the Church of the Reformers and useful to you,
have come under so much obloquy; by praying earnestly that those
in authority may have wisdom given them rightly to deliberate and
determine in this matter, and that those under authority may have
grace to render all due submission: that each and all of us may
be animated by the pure desire to enforce and observe the
Apostolic rule, &ldquo;Let all things be done decently and in
order.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">I <span

<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Let all things be done
decently and in order.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the good Providence of God, the
Reformation was effected in this country with the sanction, under
the immediate direction of the highest authorities in Church and
State; by men of sound faith, sober judgment, and calm
temperament; on the righteous principle of maintaining as good
and necessary whatever of doctrine or practice had universally
prevailed among Christians, and of not differing unnecessarily,
even in non-essentials, from the medi&aelig;val Church.</p>
<p>The conservative and Catholic feeling which animated the
Anglican Reformers very soon, however, came into conflict with a
radical and mere Protestant spirit.&nbsp; I desire not to
repudiate &ldquo;Protestantism&rdquo; as an attribute of the
Anglican Church.&nbsp; Our Reformers did most stoutly
protest&mdash;by speech, by deed, by enactment, by
suffering&mdash;against prevailing corruptions and superstitions;
specially they protested against the tyrannical assumption of
universal dominion by the Bishop of Rome, and the capricious and
lawless issuing by him of ecclesiastical prohibitions and
indulgences.</p>
<p>But their Protestantism only asserted <i>what they were
not</i>; and certainly they never prided themselves in or
contented themselves with the mere assertion of the
<i>negative</i> and the <i>diverse</i>.&nbsp; <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>In that they
put away what was wrong, or corrupt, or unedifying or distracting
or burthensome, they were Protestant; but in their maintenance of
the one faith in its integrity and the due proportion of its
several parts, in their strict adherence to the principle which
had ever guided the service and ritual of Christ&rsquo;s Church,
they were true Catholics&mdash;much more worthy of the name than
those who henceforth claimed the exclusive right to it.</p>
<p>But growing up all around them, and fostered and strengthened
by importations from the Continent, (where the Reformation had
unhappily been brought about in a very different spirit, and was
in fact almost another thing,&mdash;not the reforming of the
Church but the abandoning of it) was a revolutionary and
indiscriminate Protestantism which sought to destroy, root and
branch, whatever was old, and was intolerant even of the most
harmless conformity to the Church against which it was a
reaction.</p>
<p>Let us speak with all charity and fair allowance of those
earnest and holy men.&nbsp; Almost all the doctrines of the faith
had been perverted or leavened with corruption; almost all the
ordinances and ceremonies were associated with gross
abuses.&nbsp; In the intensity of their awakened feeling against
these things, it was natural that many among our own people,
unable to distinguish between the truth and the corruption, the
use and the abuse, should think that their rulers had not gone
far enough in the way of change; while the foreign Protestants,
left to act as individuals, driven to form communities of their
own (as their Church would not reform itself) unguided by
Catholic influence, directed by no intelligent principle (save
that which would <i>anyhow</i> get rid of false traditions and
gross abuses) in the construction of their creed and the ordering
of their services, determined, as the easiest and most congenial
course, to reject the whole system from which they had come out,
and to make all things new for themselves.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>What
wonder that such men were dissatisfied with the First Prayer Book
of Edward VI., that they regarded it as a base compromise with
Rome, that they were horrified by the mention in it of
&ldquo;priests, altars and sacrifices,&rdquo; that they scorned
as &ldquo;badges and rags of popery&rdquo; the vestments which it
prescribed; that they were loud and urgent in demanding its
immediate revision!&nbsp; Not only had they no sympathy with,
they had no comprehension, no idea of the principle on which its
compilers had acted.&nbsp; Their notion was that the only true
and pure religion was such an one as differed <i>in toto</i> from
what they had repudiated.&nbsp; They had been misled by
<i>some</i> traditions; therefore they would henceforth recognise
<i>no</i> traditions.&nbsp; The word of God had hitherto been
withheld from them: therefore now that they were able to possess
it, they would handle it as freely as they pleased.&nbsp; The
priests had domineered over them: henceforth they would have no
priests.&nbsp; Sacrifices had been offered amiss; they therefore
abhorred all sacrifices!&nbsp; Such were the feelings with which
our Reformers had at once to deal.&nbsp; Should it be a matter of
much surprise or reprehension that they dealt very indulgently
with them, that they re-cast the service which was objected to as
&ldquo;so like the mass,&rdquo; that they dealt expressions which
were injuriously misunderstood, that individual Bishops ordered
the removal of the altar lights, that the celebrant was required
to wear a surplice only?&nbsp; Recollect: it was a time of
violent re-action; moderation was interpreted as
&ldquo;compromise;&rdquo; names, ceremonies, and vestments
represented to Protestant minds not the things to which they
really belonged, but the abuses which had so long been associated
with them.&nbsp; In vain was it argued that the abuse does not
take away the use.&nbsp; In vain was it protested that the Book
of Common Prayer, as it stood, contained nothing that was
contrary to the word of God or to the teaching of the primitive
Church.&nbsp; In vain was it maintained that the Christian Church
has and must have an altar, a priesthood, a continual sacrifice
to offer; that, <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>while it is most true that Christ&rsquo;s <i>one</i>
sacrifice was <i>once</i> offered for ever, and cannot be
repeated, and that He is such a priest as knows no equal, no
successor, no partner, as alone in fact answers to the name of
priest; still, as the Jewish Church had its <i>prophetic</i>
memorials of His sacrifice&mdash;in its slaying and offering of
bulls, and goats, and lambs&mdash;and its priesthood representing
in the various acts of its office what Christ would do&mdash;so
have we, and by His own command, a <i>historical</i> memorial of
His sacrifice: &ldquo;This do in remembrance of me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;As oft as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show
forth the Lord&rsquo;s death till He come&rdquo;&mdash;and must
have a so-called priesthood, performing sacerdotal acts as His
representatives.&nbsp; In vain I say was all this urged.&nbsp;
Doubtless many of the dissentients would have readily admitted
much of it if they had calmly considered it, if they could have
believed that a <i>memorial</i> sacrifice and a
<i>representative</i> priesthood were what the Reformers claimed
to retain.&nbsp; But they could not be persuaded to listen; they
could not calm themselves sufficiently to listen; the spirit
burned within them to root out and destroy popery; and every
theological term, every religious ceremony, every ornament or
vestment that had been used by papists, was regarded as of the
very essence of popery itself!&nbsp; I believe that the reformers
were justified in making temporary concession to this state of
feeling, particularly in modifying ritual and ornament, which
could only be useful so long as they were edifying, which were in
fact doing harm to the Church&rsquo;s cause and to individual
souls while they were taken as representing and recommending the
very things which had been repudiated.&nbsp; They doubtless
justified themselves by considering that their second Prayer Book
still contained the doctrines which the offending rites and
vestments were meant to adorn; they hoped that men might come to
understand and hold those doctrines when their prejudices were
disarmed; at any rate they feared, lest, by a stubborn
maintenance or violent enforcement at that critical time of
anything not really essential, they should <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>endanger the
best interests of the Church; or even provoke and perpetuate
among us a mere Protestant reformation.&nbsp; It seemed well then
that they should make such concessions as the second Prayer Book
of Edward VI contained.&nbsp; You know what followed; how within
a year popery was established under Queen Mary, and how both
Churchmen and Protestants had to flee the land and seek a home
among German or Swiss reformers; or, if they remained, were
savagely persecuted to the death.&nbsp; It might have been
expected that the fact of Churchmen being treated as capital
offenders against Rome would have disarmed the prejudices against
them and their ritual which had hitherto existed, or at least
that common misfortunes would have begotten common interests and
sympathies and so have led to a truer appreciation of one
another.&nbsp; This was not exactly what resulted.&nbsp; The
Protestants retained and even strengthened their prejudices: the
Churchmen who had lived in exile among them first of all fell in
with their habits, their modes of worship, and their disuse of
all vestments&mdash;or the substitution for them of a black
gown&mdash;and presently they also contracted their
prejudices.&nbsp; Accordingly when, soon after the accession of
Queen Elizabeth, the old law about vestments was re-enacted, it
remained except in a few solitary cases a dead letter; men either
hated such things, or they were too indifferent to the way of
performing divine service to trouble themselves to wear them; or,
if they had right notions and right feelings about them, they
were too poor to provide them for themselves; and their
parishioners did not care, perhaps objected, to provide
them.&nbsp; I cannot but believe that it was the knowledge of
this fact&mdash;the adaptation of law to necessity&mdash;which
led to the framing in 1603 of that Canon, (so often quoted of
late) which requires parochial ministers to wear the surplice
only in their ministrations, but directs that a cope shall be
worn by the celebrant in cathedrals.&nbsp; The Convocation, it
would seem to me, knowing how generally the vestments had been
destroyed, or rapaciously seized for the sake of the gold and
precious stones <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>that adorned them, and how difficult it would be for the
clergy generally to provide them afresh, appointed&mdash;what had
long been the practice, and could in fact quote something like
authority for itself in the Royal advertisements&mdash;that as a
<i>minimum</i> of vestment in ordinary churches a surplice should
be worn, but in cathedrals, whose endowments could provide it,
the most costly and splendid of all vestments&mdash;the
cope&mdash;should be retained.&nbsp; Surely it could never have
been intended to <i>insist</i> that there should be a difference
between the cathedrals and the parish churches of the same
communion; far less to forbid as superstitious in the latter,
what is positively enjoined in the former!&nbsp; But if it were
so, the Canons, though in their spirit a rule to the Clergy and
faithful laity, have no force by the law of this realm, and
moreover they were almost immediately followed by a revised
Prayer Book, which contains the rubric ordering all the ornaments
which were in use in the second year of Edward VI.&nbsp; While at
the very last revision of the Prayer Book, nearly sixty years
afterwards, when our Church was only just lifting her head above
the politico-religious revolution which had so nearly overwhelmed
her, when so many reasons cogently pressed her to eliminate from
her Book of Common Prayer all that was unnecessary, all that was
questionable, all that she did not use or intend to use; when the
Puritans put their finger on this very rubric, and required that
it should be left out&mdash;for if it were retained it might
bring back copes, albs and such like;&mdash;it was nevertheless
deliberately determined that the rubric, made by verbal
alteration more explicit than it had been before, should continue
to be the written rule of our Church!&nbsp; <i>And</i>,
<i>brethren</i>, <i>it is still the written rule</i>,
<i>confirmed by Convocation</i>, <i>enjoined by the Act of
Uniformity</i>.</p>
<p>It is at length very generally being admitted that this is so;
that the ritualists have the written law on their side for much
of their practice: but then it is urged that precedent as to the
observance of that law is utterly wanting, that in fact there has
<a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>been a
general consent of bishops and parochial clergy (for 300 years)
that the law was not to be observed.&nbsp; I have shown you my
brethren why it could not be observed, why it had to be repealed
in Edward VI.&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; If you know anything of the
Marian persecution, and the bitter animosity against suspected
Romanism which it naturally begat; of Puritanical infatuation and
its superstitious horror at the sight of a surplice, its general
disuse of the Holy Ordinance to which &ldquo;high-ritual&rdquo;
and glorious vestments peculiarly belong, its perversity in
wearing black, simply because others wore white, in fasting (as
on Christmas day) when others were feasting; if you know anything
of the worldliness, the apathy, the deadness to Evangelical
truth, the utter ignorance of it or utter indifference to it,
which characterized the last century and the early part of
this&mdash;then you will surely be able to explain to yourselves,
why the Rubric in question has not been generally observed, you
will be surprised to find that any one has at any time observed
it.</p>
<p>I could easily show that it has been, here and there, in part
observed, almost to our own time; that it was designed by those
who first inserted it in the Prayer Book, by those who restored
it, and by those who deliberately confirmed and continued it, to
be actually used, as soon as circumstances would allow.&nbsp;
(Surely it is vain to argue on the other side, in the face of the
repeated discussions about it, and the persistent maintenance of
it; in the face, too, of the fact, that those, by whom it was
defended and preserved at the last revision, were among the men
who have most distinctly taught the doctrines which it
embodies!)&nbsp; But were it otherwise; were they one and all,
from first to last, in their own private judgments and by consent
among themselves, against its actual use, or at any rate
deliberately acquiescent in its disuse, are <i>we</i> to be bound
by their personal tastes and their private judgments, so as to
yield up what at least they have preserved and solemnly handed on
to us, what we have seen to have such full Scriptural sanction,
so to harmonize with <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the dictates of true Catholic
devotion, so to express <i>in act</i>, as, thank God! our Liturgy
does many times <i>in word</i>, that we believe and confess that
we have no way of access to God but through the Veil which Christ
has consecrated for us, even His own flesh; that He is our only
Sacrifice and the only sustaining Food of our souls; that He
condescends ever to plead for us that Sacrifice and to give to us
that Food; that on the altar He makes for us, by the hands of His
representative, the Memorial of that Sacrifice and by the same
hands gives us of the heavenly Food&mdash;He Himself Priest and
Victim both?&nbsp; This is the great, the glorious, the
soul-thrilling truth which &ldquo;high ritual&rdquo; is intended
to picture to the eye, and so to bring home to the mind and
heart; nor only nor chiefly this, but rather to express it in
worship,&mdash;in intelligent, open, adoring, thanksgiving,
splendid worship, to the Lamb that was slain, that sitteth upon
the Throne!</p>
<p>If, my brethren, we believe this to be the rationale of such
&ldquo;high-ritual&rdquo; as our Church by rubric or service
sanctions, then how can we be patient under its non-observance,
unless we feel ourselves to be hampered, like our ancestors, by
surrounding prejudices and perversities?</p>
<p>Now of course there are prejudices and perversities still
existing and many of them.&nbsp; There are men who for the love
of opposition resist and cry down ritualists.&nbsp; There are
others, who in their inmost soul are smitten with a great fear,
lest they should be beguiled of their reward in Christ, and
turned into formalists and idolaters!&nbsp; It was to be expected
that each of these classes would strenuously oppose itself to the
ritual movement and even that, though they really have little in
common, they would readily make common cause against
ritualists.&nbsp; And were it not so, did neither of them show
any outward sign of resistance, misconception, dislike, distrust
or contempt; yet the righteous dread of causing weak brethren to
offend, of shaking their confidence in those who should be their
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>spiritual
guides, of alienating their affections from their Church and
their Prayer Book and of driving them into schism, would make all
wise and loving reformers very cautious and slow to introduce
even the most desirable changes and to revive the most important
practices, very painstaking in removing prejudices and
enlightening ignorance, very patient to wait long, if need be,
for what they themselves so much appreciated and so eagerly
desired.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it is easy to see that there has never been a
time since the Reformation when men have been so able as they are
now to discriminate between what is Catholic and what is Roman,
when they could venture to confess that they had made the
discrimination, yes and to act upon it without inevitably leading
themselves or others back into the bondage from which we have
been delivered.&nbsp; Wherever the experiment has been fairly
tried it has thoroughly succeeded: it is only those who have not
tried it who doubt of, or deny the hope of its success.</p>
<p>And as there never has been a time when the ritual movement
could be so easily effected, so has there never been a time when
it was so loudly called for as it is now; first, by so many of
the worshippers, who have come to appreciate beautiful churches,
musical services, frequent celebrations, devout ceremonies and
symbolizing acts and ornaments,&mdash;and so to crave the perfect
development of the system to which these things belong; next, by
the circumstances around us, the bold denial&mdash;alas! that it
must be said even by ministers of the church&mdash;of the
precious Sacrifice and alone-availing Intercession of the
Incarnate God, which this ritual in its every part and phase
asserts and exhibits; next, by the anxious looking towards us of
Eastern and Western Christians, yearning for the re-union of
Christendom, expecting that somehow the re-union is to be brought
about by us; yet hesitating to give themselves into our hands,
because they see not in us the due recognition of the Catholic
doctrine of the Eucharist, the due rendering of objective worship
to God.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>I have
endeavoured my brethren in these sermons to set before you in the
very simplest way such a statement of the case as may disarm
prejudices, and predispose to right thoughts about ritual and
earnest endeavours to use it duly where it is offered you.</p>
<p>It remains to say a few words to those whom at the outset I
called &ldquo;hurriers along;&rdquo; to those who have gone with
the movement without considering whither it was carrying them, or
what would be the effect on others who are being left behind; to
those who in their conformity to &ldquo;high-ritual&rdquo; are
rather indulging their taste, than exercising their judgment, or
are regarding as the <i>soul</i> of worship, that which is but
the accessory, the expression, the body and clothing of
worship.&nbsp; As I have warned you before, there are great and
peculiar dangers inherent in &ldquo;high-ritual;&rdquo; its abuse
became a snare to the Jews and led them into formalism and
idolatry, even when they had inspired prophets and the very
audible voice of God to teach them; it became a like snare to our
forefathers, from which they escaped only by giving up the use as
well as the abuse; it is a snare now to millions of eastern and
western Christians; yes, and it is evidently a snare, a very
dangerous snare to many of yourselves.&nbsp; Exaggerated in
importance, regarded as an end instead of a means, followed out
into very minute detail,&mdash;its forms and expressions unduly
repeated and multiplied&mdash;it obscures the very truths which
it was meant to exhibit; it distracts the attention which it
should fix; it begets formalism, it mocks God with a worship
which is not spiritual and true, and therefore is no worship at
all; it leads its votaries to a pitiable self-ostentation, which
confirms in their prejudices the anti-ritualists, which retards
the restorers of ritual (who fear to give looser reins to those
who are already running wild), yea and well-nigh frightens them,
in their concern for souls, out of the continued observance of
what they have already restored!</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>My dear
brethren, this is sober, necessary warning.&nbsp; I pray you try
to receive it and to regulate your worship by it.&nbsp; Take heed
lest, being cumbered about many things you neglect the one thing
needful; lest, following right observances in a wrong spirit you
incur the Pharisees&rsquo; condemnation; lest, by an
indiscriminate performance of all the bowings, genuflections, and
crossings invented in medi&aelig;val or modern times, you destroy
the emphatic teaching of pure and dignified Catholic ceremonial;
lest indulging your own fancies and carrying out your own ritual,
in the face of that which the responsible officers of the
congregation by precept and example enjoin, you offend grievously
and culpably against the apostolic precept: &ldquo;Let all things
be done decently and in order.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
